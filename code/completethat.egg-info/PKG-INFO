Description: CompleteThat (v0.1dev) 
        ====================
        
        CompleteThat is a python package that solves the low rank matrix completion
        problem. Given a low rank matrix with partial entries the package solves an
        optimization problem to estimate the missing entries.
        
        Mathematically, the package solves a relaxation (using the nuclear norm or the 
        Frobenius norm of the objective matrix) of the following problem:
        
          minimize_{X} ||X||
          st. X(i,j) = M(i,j) \forall (i,j)\in \Omega,
          where, M represents the data matrix and \Omega represents the set of p
          observed entries of M
        
        Usage
        -------
        
        >>> from completethat import MatrixCompletion
        >>> problem = MatrixCompletion(M)
        >>> problem.complete_it(algo_name)
        >>> X = problem.get_matrix()
        >>> out_info = problem.get_out() 
        
        >>> from completethat import MatrixCompletionBD
        >>> problem = MatrixCompletionBD('input_data.txt')
        >>> problem.train_sgd(dimension=6,init_step_size=.01,min_step=.000001, reltol=.001,rand_init_scale=10,   maxiter=1000,batch_size_sgd=50000,shuffle=True)
        >>> problem.validate_sgd('test_data.txt')
        >>> problem.save_model()
